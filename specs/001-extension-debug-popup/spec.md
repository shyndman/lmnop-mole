# Feature Specification: Extension Debug Popup

**Feature Branch**: `001-extension-debug-popup`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "extension-debug-popup: When our extension's toolbar button is clicked, a popup will appear that will contain the extracted Markdown for the currently selected tab, displayed in a text area."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature clear: popup showing extracted markdown via toolbar button
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers/users, Actions: click button/view content, Data: extracted markdown, Constraints: current tab only
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: popup dimensions and layout preferences]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior when content extraction fails]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: whether popup auto-updates when switching tabs]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary flow: click button � see markdown content
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Toolbar button, popup display, markdown rendering, error handling
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Popup interface, extracted markdown content
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with noted clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer working with the mole extension wants to quickly inspect the extracted markdown content from any web page. They click the extension's toolbar button and immediately see the cleaned, formatted markdown content in a convenient popup window, allowing them to verify extraction quality and debug content processing issues.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a web page with extractable content is loaded, **When** user clicks the mole extension toolbar button, **Then** a popup appears showing the page's content converted to markdown in a text area
2. **Given** the popup is open with markdown content, **When** user scrolls through the text area, **Then** they can view the entire extracted content regardless of length
3. **Given** a page where content extraction fails or returns empty content, **When** user clicks the toolbar button, **Then** popup displays an appropriate message indicating no content was extracted
4. **Given** user is on a non-HTTP page (like chrome://extensions), **When** user clicks the toolbar button, **Then** popup indicates that content extraction is not available for this page type

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the markdown content is extremely long (>50KB)?
- How does the system handle pages that are still loading when the button is clicked?
- What occurs if the user switches tabs while the popup is open?
- How does the popup behave on pages with no extractable text content (e.g., image-only pages)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a clickable toolbar button in the browser's extension area
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a popup window when the toolbar button is clicked
- **FR-003**: Popup MUST contain a text area displaying the extracted markdown content for the currently active tab
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle cases where content extraction fails by showing an appropriate error message
- **FR-005**: Popup MUST be scrollable to accommodate content of any length
- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict content extraction to HTTP and HTTPS pages only
- **FR-007**: Text area MUST be read-only to prevent accidental content modification
- **FR-008**: Popup MUST remain static and not auto-update when user switches tabs
- **FR-009**: Popup MUST be sized to 260x340 pixels
- **FR-010**: Text area MUST be focused and have all content pre-selected when popup opens to enable easy copying via standard keyboard shortcuts

### Key Entities
- **Toolbar Button**: Clickable interface element in browser toolbar that triggers popup display
- **Debug Popup**: Modal window containing extracted content, with scrollable text area and appropriate sizing
- **Extracted Markdown**: Text content from current web page, processed through the existing defuddle extraction and markdown conversion pipeline
